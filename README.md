# Sorban DAO Rust Smart Contract Deployment and Testing

## Overview

This readme provides a comprehensive guide for deploying and testing a Sorban smart contract written in Rust. Sorban is a Rust-based framework for developing smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. This guide assumes that you have already set up your Rust development environment and have basic knowledge of smart contract development.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solana Command-Line Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/installation)

## Getting Started

1. **Configure the Solana Network:**

   Edit the `solana/devnet.json` file to configure the Solana network settings. Adjust the RPC endpoint and other parameters based on your deployment environment.

4. **Build Your Sorban Smart Contract:**

   Build your Sorban smart contract using the following command:

   ```bash
   sorban build
   ```

5. **Deploy Your Smart Contract:**

   Deploy your smart contract to the Solana network using the following command:

   ```bash
   ssoroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lums_dao_contract.wasm --source <Identity> --network testnet
   ```

   This command will compile your smart contract and deploy it to the configured Solana network.

6. **Test Your Smart Contract:**

   Write tests for your Sorban smart contract in the `tests/` directory. Run the tests using the following command:

   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

   Ensure that your smart contract passes all tests before deploying it to the testnet.
